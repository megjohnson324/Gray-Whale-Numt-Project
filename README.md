# Gray-Whale-Numt-Project
Nuclear copies of mitochondrial DNA fragments, or NUMTs, are generated when portions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) molecule are integrated into the nuclear genome. Nuclear copies of NUMTs can be mistaken for mtDNA and thus act as a potential source of contamination in mtDNA sequence analyses. While the nuclear and mtDNA genomes of gray whales have been successfully characterized in previous studies, studies specifically addressing NUMTs in this species are absent. We employed bioinformatics analysis to identify these sequences and aim to analyze their potential association with transposable elements and chromosomal positions to determine what facilitates NUMTs integration into the nuclear genome. This work not only aims to catalog NUMTs in the gray whale genome but also provides into the dynamics that contribute to NUMT occurrence.
